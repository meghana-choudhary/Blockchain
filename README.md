I have created and launched a custom cryptocurrency- Megcoins on a custom Blockchain created by me.
Its core features include building a blockchain where blocks are mined, verifying the validity of a chain, validating transactions using Megcoins, implementing consensus mechanism, and connecting all nodes to each other, thereby creating a decentralized network.
Technologies Used: Blockchain, Cryptocurrency Development, Postman for APIs.
